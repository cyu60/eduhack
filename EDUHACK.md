Section 1: What is EduHack?
1.1 Common Types of Hackathon
A hackathon is typically organized to address a specific societal issue, where participants present solutions to defined problems. Participants develop programs or full-stack apps that meet the relevant requirements or provide innovative perspectives.
The host could be universities or institutions, and participants are generally students. Note that although hackathons are sometimes called “programming competitions,” not all hackathons require participants to write code. For example, for those hackathons labeled as “beginner Friendly”, participants may only need to design a solution and showcase it through UI/UX prototypes.
Hackathons are usually conducted either in person or online. In-person events require participants to physically attend, while online participants may submit pre-recorded videos or present their work via Zoom.
1.2 Adaptive Hackathon Setting for GSE
EduHack is the first hackathon hosted by GSE, reimagining the traditional hackathon format through an educational lens. The event invites organizations from various fields to showcase toolkits and products seemingly unrelated to education. GSE students and Stanford affiliates will participate in a two-day in-person event to develop solutions and proposals for applying these toolkits to educational contexts. Following this, EduHack will conduct a two-month open call to collect proposals from anyone interested in education.
We aim to bridge education and technology to create mutual impact: reimagining how existing technologies can transform education and using educational insights to enhance technology.

Section 2: Stage One - In-Person GSE/Stanford Event
2.1 Event Format
The EduHack kicks off with an intensive weekend period, beginning Saturday morning and concluding Sunday evening. The first stage will be held in-person, with 30 slots open to GSE students and their teams, followed by students from other Stanford departments. The in-person component emphasizes direct collaboration between education experts and technology providers.
The in-person event will be hosted in the CERAS lobby and CERAS300 during June 7-June 8 (dates are flexible and can be adjusted). PTA (code: 1269348-122-AADAD)

Location Details
CERASLOBBY
Center For Educational Research (CERAS), 1st Floor Lobby 
Max Capacity: 60

CERAS300
Center for Educational Research (CERAS), Room 300
Max Capacity: 95

2.2 Workshops and Support
During the weekend, we will organize several workshops to help participants clarify their ideas and gain relevant knowledge. The duration of each workshop will range from 30 minutes to 1 hour.
2.2.1 Instructor-Organized Workshops
We will invite some GSE instructors to share their expertise or discuss their current research projects. We have confirmed participation from Sanne Smith (director of EDS program) and Professor Keith Bowen, with additional faculty members expressing interest.
2.2.2 GSE Student-Volunteered Workshops
We will provide a Google form for all GSE students to sign up to host their own workshops. GSE students who volunteer will need to fill out an application form, which includes details about their workshop content, why they believe their workshop would be beneficial to others, and any technical or other support they may need.
2.2.3 Mentor-Led Workshops
Representatives from participating organizations will provide hands-on guidance with their tools and resources, ensuring participants can effectively utilize provided technologies.

2.3 Event Schedule and Flow
2.3.1 Opening Day (Saturday)
The EduHack begins Saturday at 9:00 AM with an opening ceremony where we'll introduce participating organizations, announce the specific challenges, form teams, and start initial planning. Teams can begin brainstorming and exploring the provided resources.
2.3.2 Development Day (Saturday Continued)
The main day includes workshops throughout, followed by project work time. Mentors will be available to help teams with their projects. We'll provide regular check-ins to help teams stay on track.
2.3.3 Presentation Day (Sunday)
Teams will complete their projects by 2:00 PM. After submission, teams will present their work to judges. The day ends with our closing ceremony where we'll announce winners and celebrate everyone's achievements.

Section 3: Stage Two - Online Open Call
Following the in-person event, EduHack will conduct a two-month open call for global participants to submit their proposals. These submissions must demonstrate innovative applications of the organization-provided resources in educational contexts. Participants may take GSE-students’ submissions as examples.
3.1 Submission Requirements
Proposals must include a comprehensive presentation outlining the educational application, implementation strategy, and anticipated impact. Participants should provide detailed documentation of how they would utilize the organization's resources to create educational value. All submissions require a clear articulation of the problem being addressed and the proposed solution's alignment with educational objectives.
3.2 Evaluation Framework
Solutions will be assessed based on their educational impact, innovative use of organization resources, and implementation viability. The judging process emphasizes both the technical application of provided tools and the educational value creation. Each participating organization will evaluate submissions based on their specific success criteria and the solution's potential for real-world implementation.

Section 4: Prize Structure
4.1 CLF-Funded Prizes for GSE Students
The in-person component offers prizes specifically for GSE student participants, funded through the CLF. These recognize excellence in educational innovation and cross-disciplinary integration.
4.2 Organization-Sponsored Awards
Each participating organization will provide separate prizes for the online open call winners. These may include implementation opportunities, technical resources, and organization-specific rewards.
